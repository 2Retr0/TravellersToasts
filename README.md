FormidableFarmland is a small mod that aims to reduce the annoyance of unintentionally flattening farmland[^1] (upon accidental jumping/falling) in a balanced way—specifically:

## Features
- **Increasing the height at which farmland flattens** *(compared to 1.0 → 50%; 1.5 → 100%)*:
    - At 1.5 blocks → 0% chance of farmland flattening *(e.g. falling off a fence post).*
    - At 2.0 blocks → 50% chance of farmland flattening *(e.g. jumping off a fence post).*
    - At 3.5 blocks → 100% chance of farmland flattening *(e.g. falling from a house, etc.).*
* **Allowing farmland to be flattened via right-clicking with a shovel** *(will not interfere with path-making!)*\
  <sup>Note: Made as an alternative (less fun :C ) method for quickly flattening farmland in the absence of jumping.

[^1]: Yes, the preview image for this mod is clickbait—if you're wondering, the icon is just farmland with a block of netherite falling block entity shoved against it (rendered with Complementary Shaders).
